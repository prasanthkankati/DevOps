- Why shell script over tools?

the tools are rstricted in my organization somehow so i used to write the shell scripts to check the server helath of 500 vms
with custom parameters and also i dont this the perameters are available defaulty in the tools.


- date | echo "Monday" whats the output?

here Monday is output cause date is a fdefault command that always writes to systemin which doesn't return any output from the first command date.
so pipe property is to take the previous command output but previous one is not returning any output so it just execute the next one without depending on
the first one or independtly it gets executed.
