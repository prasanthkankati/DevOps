shell scripting is the way of communicating to the Linux servers and most of them are do not have GUI like windows.
GUI adds weight so user interactions should go through CLI. Most of the shell commands across all the OS destributions
CentOS, RedHat, Federo, Amazon, Ubuntu, debian vendors are same.

command to logon to instance:


man ls
man touch 

open the manual of the commands available and guide

ssh -i path/to/the/pem/file/Pandu@123/pem ubuntu@publicIPV4

ater logged in you dont know where really you are as it is Non-GUI so check for your present working directory

pwd 

List the files after connection:

ls

if you want to go to a spwcific directory from one directory:

cd path/to/directory/you/are/in

just come back onestep:

cd ..


>path/to/directory/you/are is the PWD

just come back two steps:

cd ../..

>path/to/directory

To list out the files and directory info:

like DRWRWX owner froup size created.

ls -ltr

if starts with D string then thats a directory.



Creating file:

touch starboy


Creating file and write content in it:

vi starboy

 to start editor
escape to dismiss read or write confusion the write using I

I

inserts the content 

:wq!


saves the file.


Print the file:

cat starboy

remove file:

rm starboy


cretae a directory:
mkdir star

remove a drectory:

rm -r star

SYSTEM RESOURCES USAGE
------------------------------------------------------------------

to check Total Used Free memory:

free
free -g (for better readability)


to check number of processors installed:

nproc


storage disk file size details:

df
df -h

to check manage cpu, memory together info:

top
htop


--------
Editor
--------

vi-inbuild in any linux platform
vim- has better editor and not default came with some distibutions.
do opens the same editor

ls
red.sh
vim red.sh opens the red.sh file in editor


vim ped.sh
opens the new ped.sh file in vim


always better to use touch over vim in the automation to write a files. cause if we are doing a bulk file creation and writing to them the editors are all
opened state so it can not close the previous file editer process says like the file is in use kind of so touch directly writes a file and Vim opens editor and writes in side the editor.

shell scripting
-------------

#!/bin/bash


in bin there are diffrent exexutables to run shell scripts like ksh, bash, dash, csh so we have to tell the karnal to choose bash for execution.

this should be in any of the ,sh file as first line even you try lacks of .sh files over internet.
