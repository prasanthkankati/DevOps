Terraform is iaC or APIaC tool.
Depend on the manay factor like cost and fetaures organizations may migrate and switch back to the diffrent cloud providers.
Terraform has the ability to to talk to the corresponding cloud providers targeted API using a configu files. so using the file modifications 
managing / migrations are easy acros any cloud platfm.


** Statefile: **- infra snapshot
Aight Prasanth, here’s the quick, clean breakdown — straight to the point, but still chill.

**A state file** is basically a *record keeper* for an automation or infra-as-code tool.
Think of it like a diary where the system writes down:

* what resources exist
* their current settings
* what it created earlier
* what needs to change next time

### In simple terms

It’s a **snapshot of your infrastructure’s current reality** stored in a file.

### Where you’ll see this?

Mainly in tools like **Terraform**.

### Why it's important?

* Keeps track of resources already created
* Helps avoid duplicate creation
* Allows efficient “diff” to know what changed
* Ensures safe updates or deletions

### Example

Terraform uses `terraform.tfstate`
It stores:

* VM IDs
* Network configs
* Resource dependencies
* Actual values after deployment

Without the state file, the tool is basically blind.

If you wanna know how to manage, lock, or secure a state file, just say the word.



we can collabrate the terraform files by keepinf in some version controll systems.
we can do automate the infra using terraform.
we can standardize the configuration beacuse for one CPF we have one procedure and for other CPF another procedure but we can standardize using terraform across all
----------

Process: init > Plan > Apply > destroy

configue file to statefile

1. Expect the infrastuture or requirement of infra
2. Define/write configurations to the terraform configuration files
3. It shows the output what happens 
4. depending on th e provider it creates a state file which is the proof of defined configue.
