Alright, quick and clean rundown 👇
Here’s **Kubernetes (K8s) — intro + components**, no fluff.

---

## Kubernetes (K8s) – Intro

Kubernetes is a **container orchestration platform**.
In simple terms: it **runs, manages, scales, and heals containerized apps automatically**.

Why people use it:

* Auto-scaling apps 📈
* Self-healing (restarts failed containers)
* Load balancing
* Zero/low downtime deployments
* Works great with Docker

Think of it as the **OS for your container infrastructure**.

---

## Kubernetes Architecture (High Level)

Kubernetes has **two main parts**:

1. **Control Plane (Master)**
2. **Worker Nodes**

---

## 1️⃣ Control Plane Components (Brain of K8s)

### 1. API Server

* Entry point to Kubernetes
* All commands go through this (`kubectl`, UI, CI/CD)
* Validates and processes requests

👉 *Gatekeeper of the cluster*

---

### 2. Scheduler

* Decides **which node** a Pod should run on
* Considers CPU, memory, constraints, affinity

👉 *Smart placement engine*

---

### 3. Controller Manager

* Runs controllers (Node, ReplicaSet, Deployment, etc.)
* Ensures **desired state = actual state**

Example:

* If 3 Pods needed and 1 dies → creates a new one

👉 *Auto-correct system*

---

### 4. etcd

* Distributed **key-value database**
* Stores cluster state, configs, secrets

👉 *Single source of truth*

---

## 2️⃣ Worker Node Components (Where apps run)

### 5. Kubelet

* Agent running on each node
* Talks to API Server
* Ensures containers in Pods are running

👉 *Node supervisor*

---

### 6. Container Runtime

* Runs containers
* Examples: Docker, containerd, CRI-O

👉 *Actual container engine*

---

### 7. Kube-Proxy

* Handles networking & load balancing
* Routes traffic to correct Pods

👉 *Traffic controller*

---

## Core Kubernetes Objects (Very Important)

### 8. Pod

* Smallest deployable unit
* One or more containers inside
* Shared network & storage

👉 *Container wrapper*

---

## Bonus (Common Add-ons)

* **CoreDNS** – service discovery
* **Ingress Controller** – HTTP/HTTPS routing
* **Metrics Server** – resource metrics

---

## One-line Summary

> Kubernetes automatically manages containers so your app stays **available, scalable, and resilient** without manual effort.
