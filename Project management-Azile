scrum is a time boxed approach
depends on the azile adoption template adoption and feasibility maturity of the team the time box will be defined. like 2-4 weeks ours is 3 weeks.
the time box is nothing but sprint
the goal of delivery is defined/selected/priorititzed in the sprint planning phase
capacity phase estimate the story points with complexicity depends on the Fibanocci series 1 easy,3 average ,5 can be done with a bit complexes,8 complex,13 critical
all the goals/features are defined in the backlog refinement phase


in jira> backlog tab shows > all the backlog details like goal, time line, story points list under that particular that backlog 
         Active sprints tab shows > all the story progress like a tracking and assignee details of the stories
         Reports tab shows> burn up chart, burn down chart, velocity of sprint (commited issues and delivered issues).
         by adding the confluence plugin > reports, docs, standups, retrospectives all can store there
         so in the dialy standup (scrum master/lead or someone can condut today you and tomarrow collegue if matured enough): he mark the stories and get the updates 
         peopel say i started this yesterday, working on this today it might get complted today by eod or tomarrow if no blockers. if blockers then he blocks the 
         blocker to the story. so po may resolve.

Mid-sprint review:  solution for complexes in the sprint 
           sprint ususally has the dialy standups but with the time limmitatation to 30-40 minutes mostly. where we can not talk all the blockers and problems.
           so for example usually a story has 3 points intially but after starting it was added more with 6-10 points and becomes a hard blockers in some points so 
          this kind of issues will be discussed in mid sprint to achieve them.





Product grooming -define goals and prioritize the goals
Backlog Grooming
Sprint daily standups
Mid sprint review


Make sure backlog items are clear, correct, and ready for future sprints.

What happens in Backlog Refinement?
Clarify user stories
Add acceptance criteria
Break large stories into smaller tasks
Prioritize based on business value
Estimate (Story Points)
Remove outdated items---------

Below is the **MOST complete explanation** of Agile & Scrum **ceremonies**, **phases**, **technical terminology**, and **definitions** — written in a **real-time IT company model**, easy to understand and interview-ready.

I added visual image groups to help you understand how these ceremonies look in real teams.

# 🧭 **AGILE DELIVERY – FULL PHASES + SCRUM CEREMONIES**


# 🚀 **AGILE PHASES (END-to-END Delivery Flow)**

## 1️⃣ **Requirement Phase**

* Product Owner gathers inputs from clients/stakeholders
* Creates **Product Backlog**
* High-level features are called **Epics**
* Epics → broken into **User Stories**

---

## 2️⃣ **Planning Phase**

* Prioritization of backlog
* Release planning (for months)
* Sprint planning (for 2–3 weeks)

---

## 3️⃣ **Execution Phase**

* Development
* Testing
* DevOps CI/CD
* Code review
* Deployment to QA/UAT

---

## 4️⃣ **Review Phase**

* Demonstration to stakeholders
* Acceptance of stories
* Feedback captured

---

## 5️⃣ **Retrospective Phase**

* Team identifies improvements
* Action items planned for next sprint

---

## 6️⃣ **Release Phase**

* Final testing
* Production deployment
* Monitoring and user feedback

---

# 🎯 **SCRUM CEREMONIES (Done Inside Each Sprint)**


# 1️⃣ **BACKLOG REFINEMENT (Grooming)**

🕒 When: Weekly
👥 Who: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Dev, QA, DevOps
🎯 Goal: Make future stories **clear, small, and ready**.

### 🔍 What happens?

* PO reads each story
* Team asks questions
* Add **Acceptance Criteria**
* Split large stories (Epics → Stories → Tasks)
* Estimate story points
* Remove outdated items
* Prioritize based on business value

### Output:

✔ Stories become **READY** state
✔ Feature understanding is clarified

---

# 2️⃣ **SPRINT PLANNING**


🕒 When: Day 1 of sprint
👥 Who: PO, SM, Dev, QA, DevOps
🎯 Goal: Decide **what work** the team will complete.

### 🔍 Steps:

1. PO presents prioritized stories
2. Team checks **capacity**
3. Break stories → **Technical Tasks**
4. Estimate hours per task
5. Set the **Sprint Goal**
6. Commit stories for sprint

### Output:

✔ Sprint Backlog
✔ Clear tasks for each team member

---

# 3️⃣ **DAILY STANDUP (Daily Scrum)**


🕒 When: Daily, 15 min
👥 Who: Entire Scrum team
🎯 Goal: Sync progress + remove blockers.

### 🔍 Format:

Each member answers:

1️⃣ **What did I do yesterday?**
2️⃣ **What will I do today?**
3️⃣ **Any blockers?**

### DevOps Example:

* “Yesterday: fixed CI pipeline failure.”
* “Today: configure UAT environment.”
* “Blocker: need firewall rule from infra team.”

### Output:

✔ Daily alignment
✔ Early risk identification

---

# 4️⃣ **SPRINT EXECUTION**


🎯 Goal: Build and test stories.

### Activities:

* Development
* Testing
* Code review
* CI/CD execution
* Monitoring
* Bug fixing
* Deployment to QA/UAT

### Output:

✔ Increment (working software)

---

# 5️⃣ **SPRINT REVIEW (DEMO)**

🕒 When: Last day of sprint
👥 Who: Team + stakeholders
🎯 Goal: Demonstrate completed features.

### 🔍 Steps:

1. Developer demos feature
2. QA confirms testing
3. DevOps explains infra updates if needed
4. Stakeholders give feedback
5. PO accepts or rejects stories

### Output:

✔ Accepted work
✔ Requirements for future sprints

---

# 6️⃣ **SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE**

🕒 When: After review
👥 Who: Scrum team only
🎯 Goal: Improve team process.

### 🔍 Format:

* **What went well?**
* **What didn’t go well?**
* **What improvements next sprint?**

### Output:

✔ Continuous improvement
✔ Action items for next sprint

---

# 7️⃣ **RELEASE / DEPLOYMENT (Outside Scrum ceremonies)**

🕒 When: After multiple sprints (depends on company)
👥 Who: DevOps, QA, Dev, PO
🎯 Goal: Push new features to production.

### 🔍 Steps:

* Final testing
* CI/CD build
* Deployment
* Smoke testing
* Monitoring

### Output:

✔ Production release
✔ Go-Live confirmation

# 🧩 **AGILE TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY (With Clear Definitions)**

## 📌 **Epic**

Large feature broken into smaller stories.
**Example:** “User Management System”

---

## 📌 **User Story**

Small requirement written from user perspective.
“As a user, I want to reset password so that I can access my account.”

---

## 📌 **Task / Subtask**

Development or technical work needed to complete a story.
**Example:** “Create API for reset password”

---

## 📌 **Acceptance Criteria**

Conditions to confirm story is done.
**Example:** “OTP must expire in 5 minutes.”

---

## 📌 **Story Points**

Complexity measurement (not time).
Used for planning velocity.

---

## 📌 **Definition of Ready (DoR)**

Checklist before story enters a sprint.
✔ Acceptance criteria
✔ Estimated
✔ Clear requirement
✔ Dependencies resolved

---

## 📌 **Definition of Done (DoD)**

Checklist before story is considered completed.
✔ Code complete
✔ Code reviewed
✔ Unit tested
✔ Deployed to QA
✔ No open defects

---

## 📌 **Sprint Goal**

# 🧠 **READY-TO-USE REALTIME MODEL (Interview Friendly)**

Here is the entire Agile cycle in one flow:

1. **Product Owner creates backlog**
2. **Backlog Refinement** clarifies user stories
3. **Sprint Planning** selects stories
4. **Daily Standup** tracks progress
5. **Sprint Execution** (Dev + QA + DevOps work)
6. **Sprint Review** demos finished work
7. **Retrospective** identifies improvements
8. **Release** moves software to production
