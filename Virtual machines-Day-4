on a physical server > if we isolate virtualization then each VM machine has its own cpu own hardware and own memory
means we can utilize the server hardware in very effecieng way
for ex if server has 100Gb memory then in ghat if we install only one app of size 5MB. the remaining resources of the physical HP sever got wasted.
so to fix that ineefeciency problem.
a big leap has evolved that the datacenters have physical servers installed on racks.
each server has hypervysor istalled on them.
so when we reqest the hyper vysor to create a VM manually or automation that takes input and provide VM in return.
so that has IP and keypair to get access virtually.
gaint comapies doing business with this concept of effeciency of resources only.
