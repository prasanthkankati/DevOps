Here are simple, clear, interview-friendly answers 👇

⸻

✅ What is Infrastructure Management?

Infrastructure Management means managing all the IT resources needed to run applications—like servers, storage, networks, operating systems, and cloud resources.

In DevOps, it includes:
	•	Provisioning servers (EC2, VM)
	•	Managing networks (VPC, subnets, security groups)
	•	Monitoring and maintaining uptime
	•	Scaling infrastructure automatically
	•	Keeping resources secure and cost-optimized

⸻

✅ What is Configuration Management in DevOps?

Configuration Management means defining and maintaining the desired state of systems automatically.

Example:
	•	Installing required software
	•	Setting correct versions (Java, Nginx, Node)
	•	Ensuring correct configurations (ports, users, packages)

It ensures:
✔ No manual setup
✔ Consistency across environments (dev → test → prod)
✔ Fast recovery when servers crash

⸻

✅ Tools for Infrastructure & Configuration Management

Infrastructure Management / IaC Tools

Used to create servers, networks, load balancers, etc.
	•	Terraform (most common, cloud-agnostic)
	•	CloudFormation (AWS)
	•	Pulumi

Configuration Management Tools

Used to configure the servers after provisioning.
	•	Ansible (agentless, very popular)
	•	Chef
	•	Puppet
	•	SaltStack

Container Orchestration (related to infra management)
	•	Kubernetes
	•	Docker Swarm

⸻

✅ What is Key-gen?

key-gen usually refers to the command ssh-keygen.

ssh-keygen = A tool used to generate SSH key pairs

These keys are:
	•	Public Key (shared)
	•	Private Key (kept secret)

⸻

✅ What is the Use of key-gen?

It is used to generate secure authentication keys that avoid passwords.

Key-gen helps in:

🔹 1. SSH Login Without Passwords

Logging into servers (Linux, EC2) securely.

Example:

ssh-keygen
ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@server


⸻

🔹 2. Git Authentication

GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket use SSH keys so you don’t enter username/password every time.

⸻

🔹 3. CI/CD Secure Machine Access

Jenkins → Server
GitLab Runner → Server
Automation tools use SSH keys for secure communication.

⸻

🔹 4. Cloud Access

AWS EC2 key pairs are generated using ssh-keygen or AWS console.

⸻

🔹 5. Secure File Transfer

Tools like scp, rsync, sftp use SSH keys.
